		2) all threads should be monitored and kept track of and cleaned up when asked to.
		3) all modules should respond to standard commands.

	/**
		Rules:
		1) FEEL FREE to read information in from files. 
		2) If this is like the camera, and a command comes in to connect to camera, dont read configuration than. Load configuration NOW.
		3) dont open hardware or pipes or sockets now, there is a command for that. Open it at that time, only read files.
		4) listeners should also be setup HERE. If you want to listen to some event, take listener_flag and | it with the event flag.
